# CS210 Personal Project
## *LOL Teams Managing Tool*

## Introduction

**The main purpose of *LOL Teams Managing Tool* is to act as a system for recording and managing team and player 
information for a popular video game, League of Legends (LOL).** While its intended purpose is to record and display 
information for professional League of Legends e-sports, it can also be used for managing players and teams in casual 
play. Due to the nature of e-sports and quite simply, professional sports in general, it can be difficult to keep track 
of the teams in a league as well as their current roster of players. This application helps LOL e-sports fans to keep 
track of and easily visualize the players on each team in a league. This can also be useful for small tournament 
organizers to manage teams and team rosters for their tournaments. The application lets you enter statistics and 
information about players, view the list of teams in a region/league as well as the list of players on each team. 

Possible features could include a search bar that allows users to search for specific players by their name, and 
additionally, filtering players by categories (role they play, the region they play in, etc.) 


## Background information
### Why did I choose to do this specific project?

My idea for this project stems from my frustration with many pre-existing League of Legends e-sports wikis. Instead of 
being able to view all the current teams in a league along with their roster for the current season, many popular wikis 
are structured so that users must click on a team in order to view their roster. Furthermore, for those that do include 
the teams' current rosters, they are formatted in a table like a spreadsheet, making it impossible to select a player 
from the same page and view their statistics and information. I myself, like many of my friends, are huge fans of LOL 
e-sports, and we would often discuss and debate our predictions and rankings for each team, especially at the beginning 
of each competitive season. However, without being able to view the players on each roster at a glance, as well as being 
able to check their stats from the same application, it takes much more effort to be able to evaluate each team 
holistically. This is the main reason why I decided on *LOL Teams Managing Tool* as my CS210 personal project. 


## Additional information
If it is still not quite clear, for this application, X could be a player, and Y would be a team with a list of players, 
and X could also be a team, while Y would be a competitive region/league.
